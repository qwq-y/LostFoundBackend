## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Motivation and Background

- **Solve the problem of lost belongings of students and staff:** students and staff often lose belongings in the school, especially important items such as mobile phones, wallets and campus cards, which will bring great trouble and loss to the parties. Develop a small program for school lost and found, can provide a convenient, fast, efficient channel to help users find lost items, reduce the loss of users.

- **Improve the service level of the school:** The development of the lost and found mini program can help the school improve the service quality and management level, enhance the sense of belonging and satisfaction of students and staff, and thus enhance the reputation and competitiveness of the school.

- **Integrate school resources:** there may be multiple departments and service organizations within the school, such as the Student union, campus card center, security Department, etc., and the lost and found information collected by them may be scattered, repeated, and not timely. Develop a small program for school lost and found, which can integrate the resources and information inside the school, improve the efficiency and accuracy of information circulation, and facilitate users to find the lost items.

- **Promote the construction of digital campus:** The development of a small lost and found program for schools can promote the construction of digital campus, help schools realize the goals of information sharing, resource integration, service optimization and so on, and gradually realize the construction of smart campus.

### 1.2 Target User or Clients Characteristics

- **Target users:** For the lost and found scene within the school, the target users can be students, teachers, staff, etc.
- **Users Characteristics:** 
  - **Students:** These users are usually young people who may have varying levels of technology and digital literacy, and can pick up small programs quickly, taking into account the types of items they may be looking for, such as electronic devices, books, stationery, etc.
  - **Teachers:** These users usually take classes at set times, so applets need to provide a sort of location and time classification so they can post lost and found information quickly.
  - **Other staffs:** These users may be the first to find the lost items, but the location of the lost items is difficult to describe, and the items will be placed in a specific lost and found location, so it is necessary to provide the classification of the lost and found to upload the found items, and provide the corresponding location to obtain the items. In addition, they may need to see a list of all the missing items and relevant information.

## 2. Development Process

- This report outlines the development process for a lost and found management system that is being developed using the Prototyping model of development.

### 2.1 Process Models

- The Prototyping model of development was chosen for this project because it is iterative in nature and allows for quick development and testing of a working model of the system. This model is ideal for projects where requirements are not completely defined, and changes are expected throughout the development process.

- The prototyping model consists of four stages: requirements gathering, prototype design, prototype development, and prototype testing. We will start by gathering requirements from stakeholders and end-users, create a prototype design based on the gathered requirements, develop the prototype, and test the prototype to identify any errors or issues. This process will be repeated until the final version of the system is developed.

### 2.2 Project Divisions of Labor

To ensure the successful development of the lost and found management system, the following team roles are necessary:

- Project Manager: Responsible for overseeing the project, ensuring that it stays on track and within budget. The project manager will also be responsible for coordinating with the other team members and ensuring that everyone is meeting their deliverables.
